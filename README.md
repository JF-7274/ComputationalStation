# Computational Station
This is the repository for the educational part of a [National Science Foundation](https://www.nsf.gov) proposal. 

## Objective
The objective is to create a **cost-effective and portable computer cluster** using [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.com) and the [OpenHPC](https://openhpc.community) stack.
A portable computer cluster will **empower students to perform simple simulations** in the area of computational chemistry and computational materials science.
