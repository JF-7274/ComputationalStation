# ComputationalStation
This is the repository for the educational part of an NSF proposal 

The objective is to create a **cost-effective and portable computer cluster** using Raspberry Pi and the OpenHPC stack.
A portable computer cluster will **empower students to perform simple simulations** in the area of computational chemistry and computational materials science.
